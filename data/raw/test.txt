Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on 
building systems that can learn from data. Deep learning is a type of 
machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that deals with the 
interaction between computers and human language. Large Language Models 
like GPT and Claude are examples of NLP applications.

Vector databases are used to store embeddings for similarity search.
They are essential for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
